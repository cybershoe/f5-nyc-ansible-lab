Lab 2: Running the first playbook
=================================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

In this lab, we will run a playbook that will create a configuration on 
a BIG-IP. This is a very basic configuration, consisting of one virtual
server, one pool, and three pool members.

Objective
---------

-  Understand the basic structure of an Ansible Playbook

-  Deploy a simple BIG-IP configuration using Ansible

Lab Requirements
----------------

-  SSH or Terminal access to the Ubuntu Jumpbox/Ansible Host

-  Access to the BIG-IP TMUI (Web GUI)

Estimated completion time: 10 minutes

TASK 1 - Review the BIG-IP configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Log in to the BIG-IP web GUI.

2. From the left-hand navigation menu, expand the **Local Traffic** section

3. Explore the **Virtual Servers**, **Pools**, and **Nodes** sections

There should be no pre-existing configuration on the BIG-IP


TASK 2 â€‘ Review the first playbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.	From the SSH or terminal session, change into the demo1 folder:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/demo1

2.	List the files in the demo1 folder:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ ls

  .. NOTE:: You will see an "inventory" directory. The *hosts* file in this
    directory usually contains lists of hosts to run plays against, and may also
    contain grouping information and additional information about those hosts.
    In this lab, because the F5 Ansible modules use the iControlREST API and run
    locally rather than connecting to the BIG-IP directly via SSH, the inventory 
    file only contains one entry, *locahost*.

3.  Examine the first.yaml playbook:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ less first.yaml

  .. NOTE:: Use the arrow keys or PgUp/PgDn to scroll through the file. Use
    the "q" key to quit back to the prompt.

Take a look at the structure of the playbook. How many tasks are there? How do
the F5 modules know how to connect to the BIG-IP system being confugured?

TASK 3 - Run the first playbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the SSH or terminal session, run the following command to create the 
new virutal environment:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts first.yaml

Watch the output of the ansible-playbook command.

Task 4: Inspecting the results of the first playbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Back in the BIG-IP GUI, go back to the **Virtual Servers**, **Pools**, and
**Nodes** screens. How has the configuration changed after running the 
playbook? 

.. NOTE:: Keep your SSH or terminal session open for the next lab.
